This is the only nontrivial step, and in the latest version #of Rails all these features come for free with one method, has_secure_password   -- As long as there is a password_digest column in the database, adding this one #method to our model gives us a secure way to create and authenticate new users. http://ruby.railstutorial.org/chapters/modeling-users#sec-has_secure_password
